I'm interested in computers: hardware, software, administration, *etc.*

You can find my resum√© [here](/resume.pdf).

I've been known to [write code](http://www.github.com/scott-linder/).

I use [Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), Windows, and Mac OS X everyday.

I'm currently at [WMU](http://www.wmich.edu/) studying Computer Science; I am
the webmaster for the WMU [Computer Club](http://ccowmu.org/) and work as a
system administrator at the [CAE Center](http://www.wmich.edu/engineer/cae/).

If you want to get a hold of me, shoot me an
[email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
